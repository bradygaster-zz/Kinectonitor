# Kinectonitor 
Demonstration of a home-spun home security system that uses the Kinect, Windows Azure Service Bus, and SignalR to provide a near-real-time video monitor. The image capture is triggered by the Kinect's skeleton recognition event handler. When the Kinect "sees" someone is in the room, it takes a photo and publishes it to the Azure cloud.
